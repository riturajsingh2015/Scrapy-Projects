I am justifying my prices by the fact that I don't have a company number yet (I am doing that to be able to spare money and get one) and also because I am willing to showcase the work done for you in the online portfolio I am building.\n\nDoes it sounds like something interesting to you?\nAre you a well established entrepreneur willing to contribute to my dream by giving me a chance?\nPlease, send me a message and let me know a bit more about your project.\nI'll come back to you and we will set a meeting.\n\nPS: I speak French, English, Dutch and Spanish.
